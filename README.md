A Universal Scale in Galaxy Dynamics: Testing the Gravitational Polarization Field on Galaxies and Clusters
🌌 Manifesto of a Hybrid Journey: Human + AI

I am 65 years old. I don’t hold a degree.
What I do have is curiosity, a critical mind, and the conviction that so-called “absolute truths” are often just hypotheses dressed as dogmas.

For fifty years, science has chased dark matter and dark energy. Decades of telescopes, models, and simulations. The result? Still nothing. Two free parameters that can be tuned to fit almost anything. But what they actually are, nobody knows.

So I thought: if the equations don’t balance, maybe we need to change the terms.

🔮 Going Back to the Beginning

I imagined the Big Bang.
Not as the textbooks describe it, but as a laboratory of possibilities.

Before space, before time, before matter and energy—there could have been many different physical laws. Not infinite—because infinity feels like magic—but a vast, finite number. Maybe nature “tested” them all at once, and only the coherent ones survived.

Maybe multiple universes.
Maybe just one, where part of it became matter and energy while the rest remained in an undefined state, invisible but ever-present.
Maybe this is what permeates the cosmos and shapes the galaxies.

🛠️ My Laboratory

I didn’t have a particle accelerator.
I didn’t have a team of researchers.
I didn’t even have a degree to show.

What I had was:

a modest PC,

an internet connection from my phone’s hotspot,

a pen and paper for scribbles,

a few cigarettes to ease the tension,

and most importantly: artificial intelligences.

I debated with them for hours.
I asked questions, got answers, found mistakes, retried, corrected.
And within days, I had a model, equations, plots. A full scientific-style paper.

📐 The Circle Anecdote

Imagine living in a time before π (pi) was known.
You have a circle and want to compute its area. You don’t know the formula, but you can measure radius and circumference. By dividing the circle into triangles and summing their areas, you get an empirical formula that works—even without knowing π.

That’s what my parameter 
A
A is.
I don’t yet know where it comes from theoretically, but empirically it works.
And that’s enough to begin the journey.

🤝 The True Discovery

The point is not whether my theory is right or wrong.
The point is that science is no longer the exclusive domain of billion-dollar labs or academic titles.

With AI, even a 65-year-old man, with no degree, but with imagination and persistence, can create in just a few days a structured, data-driven, testable scientific work.

This marks the dawn of a new era:

the era of hybrid science, where human intuition and AI precision intertwine,

the era of democratized knowledge, where anyone, anywhere, can contribute.

🚀 The Message

My paper is not the end of a story. It’s the beginning of a movement.
It’s not just about cosmology.
It’s about what science will become when every curious mind, armed with AI, can explore the universe.

Maybe my formulas will fade away. Maybe they’ll be replaced someday.
But the proof that an ordinary man, in one week, with free AI tools, can write a scientific paper—that will remain.

And it will be impossible to ignore.
